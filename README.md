## About Me

Hi, I’m **Feral** 👋  
I’m a developer with a strong interest in **automation**, **tooling**, and **systems programming**, particularly around games and networking.

- 👀 **Interests:** Game automation, bots, scripting, and data-driven tools  
- 🔭 **Current focus:** Maintaining **Feral Engine**, a custom game engine, and building a couple of games with it as a hobby  
- 🌱 **Education:** Computer Science & Electrical Engineering  
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I often spend more time building tools to solve problems than fixing the problems directly  
- 💞️ **Collaboration:** Open to collaborating on a wide range of projects  
- 📫 **Contact:**  
  - **Discord:** `rioterneeko`

## Notice

All repositories have been archived until **December 2025** while I refactor and modernize older projects with most of them going into **private** mode. If you still need access for the private projects, contanct me on **Discord**.

Revisiting them with more experience highlighted several issues-inefficiencies, duplicated logic, and, in some cases, incomplete or broken implementations. The goal of this cleanup is to bring everything up to my current standards for structure, performance, and maintainability.

Once this process is complete, I’ll be publishing updated versions along with newer work, including:

- **Feral Engine**, my custom game engine (actively maintained)  
- A couple of **games built using Feral Engine**  
- **Networking projects**, including peer-to-peer and dedicated server architectures  
- A **Python Steamworks module with multiplayer support**  
- **Advanced tooling** for data analysis and game automation  
- Several **custom bots**, primarily for Discord and select game-related use cases  

If you’re interested in any of these projects or would like early access, feel free to reach out on **Discord**.
