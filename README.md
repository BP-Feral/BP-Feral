# Notice

I've archived all my repositories until **November 2024** as I work on updating the older projects.  
Revisiting them with my current knowledge has been an eye-opener—they were inefficient, filled with duplicate code, and sometimes outright broken.

Once I've revamped these projects, I'll also be adding my recent work, including:  
- My **Steam game**, made with my own python engine and logic
- Some **Networking** projects, peer to peer or dedicated server
- A **Python Steamworks module that supports multiplayer**  
- Various **advanced tools**, for analyzing various data including game automation
- A few **unique bots**, mostly for discord and a few for games.

If you're curious about these or want early access, feel free to contact me on **Discord**!

**BP-Feral/BP-Feral** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
